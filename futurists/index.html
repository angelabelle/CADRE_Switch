		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>The future of successful medical practices and healthcare rely on digital technologies. As we move towards a more digital future, 3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) will have an increased presence in the medical field. The implementation of each of these digital practices in the near future provides new and separate benefits that previously have been unattainable without these new technologies.</p>

	<p>The future of medicine is digital. As technology continues to evolve, the application of 3D printing, artificial intelligence and augmented reality will impact the medical field and allow for benefits that were previously unattainable through doctors alone. As digital technologies advance, the possibilities of medical aide for all, despite location or circumstances advance too.</p></div>

		<h2>3D Printing</h2>
		<p>3D printing is a great example of technology that is currently being adapted in order to serve a variety of purposes outside of its original intent. Originally used to create production pieces in the late 80’s, 3D printing is now breaking into health education and healthcare. The use of 3D technology in the healthcare industry is estimated to increase by 21% in the next decade. Thinking small scale, one hope for this fusion of fields would be to 3D print specific body parts for surgeons to practice on. Currently, once students are ready to practice operating, they take up a residency/internship and are closely supervised by a teacher while working with and on human patients. This is incredibly stressful for all involved. Until confident in their practice, being able to successfully execute an operation on a 3D printed replica instead of an actual human being cuts back on many of the risks involved in this learning process. The possibilities for the partnership between 3D printing and the medical field go far beyond this.</p>

<p>In order to reach the full potential of this amalgam of fields, we must transcend the boundaries of what 3D printing even is. Many of the restrictions that 3D printing has faced have been because of the previous materials it has been attributed to using. However, today the multitude of materials available for 3D printing are continuously expanding. So much so, that recently skin cells have been added to this list. With these types of restrictions and barriers minimizing, the possibilities for coalescing 3D printing and the medical field are endless.</p>

<p>Yes, 3D printed organs for transplants, 3D printed skin and even 3D printed prescription drugs are all current possibilities, but we can take it even further and visualize a future where 4D printing is a reality. The future of this technology adds the dimension of transformation through time. 3D printing paired with shape memory polymers (smart material that returns to its original shape with the presence of external stimulus after being disfigured), creates the future technology of 4D printing. In his ted talk, Skylar Tibbits referred to 4D printing as “3D-printed structures with an embedded capability of spatiotemporal transformation.” Using this technology and even possibly pairing it with biodegradable and non toxic materials or even soft robotics could create massive and progressive changes in the healthcare industry. We could use this fusion to make things like small, minimally invasive surgical tools that have the capability to shrink and expand depending on light exposure. Another possibility is the creation of biodegradable, non-toxic, 4D printed temporary stitches for various surgeries. The future of micro medical tools provides a more forgiving, and less intrusive alternative to what will soon be antiquated technology.</p>

<p>Another idea that will advance in the medical field is Soft robotics. Soft robotics is a robotic ingenuity that is made from flexible materials that could help advance the medical field. Soft robotics could do this by achieving “combinations of contraction, extension, bending and twisting with simple control inputs such as pressurized fluid” (Harvard). With millions of people having suffered from chronic stroke in the US some survivors have had loss of hand or other motor mobilities. Currently with soft robotics, they “are developing a modular, safe, portable, consumable, at-home hand rehabilitation and assistive device that aims to improve patient outcomes by significantly increasing the quantity (i.e. time) and quality of therapy at a reduced cost while also improving independence of users with chronic hand disabilities by enabling them to perform activities of daily living” (Harvard). In the future, soft robotics will advance to a cost efficient way for people to help them do daily activities that have prevented their bodies to function due to medical reasons.</p>

		<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
		<p>Like 3D printing, the future of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field will not only advance medicine but will undoubtedly save many lives. As AI continues to advance every day, the projection of AI’s capabilities in the future anticipate that AI will be able to diagnose patients and help people seek the medical attention they need, whether it be at home or at the hospital. It can be the solution for world health in areas which doctors aren’t widely available, allowing access to medical help despite a patient’s location.  Patients that need medical advice will potentially be diagnosed by AI through data such as medical history reports, image data, and blood tests that could help clinicians speed up the process of evaluating a patient. Using a process called Machine Learning (a form where AI can gather massive amounts of data and determine a conclusion for the patient’s condition3), AI can assist in people’s daily lives and aid clinicians in making decisions based on what the AI has gathered from its report. More advanced AI has the potential save even more lives by being able to distinguish between patients who are at higher risk and need immediate treatment, from those who are at a lower risk and don’t need immediate medical attention.</p>

		<p>In addition to providing new ways of diagnosing patients, Artificial Intelligence can and will also provide improvements for services and methods already in place.  One successful example of this is within the subject of medical image data.  Currently, there is a plethora of medical image data that is sorted and organized everyday.  Implementing AI in the sorting procedure would speed up the process, making the readings and sortments more accurate and time efficient.  AI can also offer a wider range of medical solutions that one doctor alone cannot. </p>
	
<p>Based on the potential of AI in the medical field, Stanford University conducted a research project named ChexNet4. ChexNet is an AI program designed to diagnose pneumonia based on x ray images of frontal chest views.  It’s a successful fusion of AI’s diagnostic potentials and the integration of AI within medical image data.  The utilization of ChexNet proved to be a more accurate way of analyzing thousands of different images that even the most skilled radiologist could misdiagnose.  It reduced errors and in the end,  the ChexNet algorithm beat and outperformed four of Stanford’s qualified radiologists.</p>

<p>Although Artificial Intelligence will continue to advance and improve in the future, it will not replace doctors, but instead, support them. One of the main reasons AI is incapable of replacing doctors outright, is because AI lacks emotions. AI’s absence of human emotions will not allow for even the most advanced AI systems to communicate on a personal or compassionate level that resonates with patients, therefore causing patients to continue to seek human doctors.  AI’s deficiency in human emotions and morals also leads to a lack of complete trust in AI’s capabilities.  This is based on the fact that AI systems are made specifically to gather data and evaluate situations and diagnostics based only on the gathered data. Due to this, people may not always naturally opt to believe them.  In addition, another important reason that AI is only capable of offering support to physicians instead of replacement is simply the fact that AI’s are not designed or trained to become or act as full fledged doctors. They are meant to gather information/data on patients and suggest possible outcomes or diagnoses, but it is still the doctor’s primary job to evaluate the patient’s condition based on this gathered data.

		<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
		<p>Alongside 3D printing and AI, augmented reality is another digital technology that is being implemented in the medical field and with continuing advancements, has the potential to change the industry. Currently, the use of augmented reality has been successful and promising in the medical field thus far. Augmented reality applications are being developed to help train medical professionals and help guide students to prepare them for actual procedures and surgeries. (Barsom) AR can be used as a navigation tool for surgical procedures and can help enhance visualizations in the operating room. AR has been used to create reconstructions of the human body in real time to make surgery easier and allow for doctors to have a more precise visual of the surgery before making any incisions. It has already been applied to neurosurgery and various other types of surgeries. (Shuhaiber) AR applications can also be used as a therapeutic tool for patients. AR is being developed to help treat people with phobias and other psychological disorders as well. Augmented reality adds an extra layer to virtual reality (VR), allowing for it to be more interactive and more effective in assisting doctors and nurses during both check-ups and surgery. (Marescaux) In addition, AR is also being used to help patients and doctors communicate better, giving patients a better understanding of what is happening and allowing doctors a more thorough opportunity to see and diagnose any additional problems with the patient that may need attention. AR is helping to increase the success rate of medical procedures. AR is in development to become simpler and easier for physicians to use and obtain feedback from so it can become more available to doctors all over the world.</p>

<p>The future of AR can be the key to faster and more accurate medical procedures. It has the capabilities to allow for doctor-patient interaction to be more personable and helpful. With advanced AR technology we can digitally project patient records and medical history during check ups or operations rather than only having access on paper charts or stationary computers. This can assist the doctor not only with patient data, but medical information such as organ replacements and the patient’s vital levels during surgery. Naturally, this can allow for more space in operating spaces and hospital rooms by removing unnecessary, antiquated machines, whose only job is to display this type of data. Google Glass is already been on track to make these possibilities a reality. Imagine advancing current technology in a way that allows for doctors to put on glasses and be able to x-ray patients. Inventions like these have promising potential to speed up diagnostic times. Visual technologies displayed in this way not only assist doctors, but can offer visual representations for patients that help them better understand their health, issues or procedures at hand.</p>
