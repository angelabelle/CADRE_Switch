      <p><span style="font-size:24px">With the global expansion of the internet, many individuals have been subject to sexist actions pinned against them.</span> In particular, more sexist actions have been present in today’s rising gaming culture, evident in the games themselves as well as in their communities. Today, we see gender disparity, overtly sexual women game avatars, and institutional sexism. It is not just present within video games, but rather the entirety of society where all of these vile principles are acceptable. While it is impossible to totally eradicate such sexism, the last decade has proven video games as one of the most powerful cultural influences of this generation. In face of this issue, intersectionality should be celebrated while the anonymity present in the internet echo chamber should be discouraged. It only puts a bandaid on a deep-rooted problem of people behaving in ignorant ways without fear of repercussions.</p>

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Historically, women have been seen and treated as inferior to men</span> — housewives, maids, homecooks, objects, caretakers of the home — any glance at advertisements from the 1950’s will show this unfortunate view of women; a coffee ad was notorious for depicting a husband spanking his wife who was bent over his lap because she was not serving him “fresher coffee” — the ad proclaimed that their product would prevent husbands from beating their wives… over coffee. Not only did they treat the issue of a husband beating his wife as an expected outcome, they used it as a selling point for their product. This kind of sentiment carried over into Hollywood as well and spread throughout the world. It used to be common script that an American film star would be bombastic, muscly, and portrayed as a sexist hero while rescuing a damsel in distress (whom is typically portrayed with revealing clothing). Johnny Cage, a playable character from the game series <i>Mortal Kombat,</i> reflects this archetype. However, before video games took up the mantle of being the biggest entertainment industry, movies held that title for much longer, and subsequently, have been under critical eyes for a larger portion of time. The result? Movies are pulling ahead of games in terms of addressing issues such as sexism and racism, at least on the surface. It used to be unheard of that we would get a film about a Disney princess who would work hard for what she wanted and teach the prince a lesson, but we did with The <i>Princess and the Frog</i>, released in 2009. Of course, one positive film does not mean racism and sexism have been resolved, but it shows signs of growth, especially in other entertainment media where representation to its viewers is incredibly important. After the film, there was an increase of positive outcry from social media, of people talking about how young black girls were thrilled to see a princess like them on screen. And the trend has continued — <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse</i> had Miles Morales, a young black teenager, as the protagonist, and the impact was just as positive and large for the many moviegoers and comic-readers.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Furthermore, in the aspect of games, this negative portrayal and representation of women has been carried into the development of games.</span> Game development companies have been predominantly dominated by men, with female designers, programmers, and producers only constituting to a small fragment of this blooming business. Because this business is mainly established by men, these men, driven by the incentive of money, further solidify these poor ideals of women with overtly sexual representations. Female game characters perpetuate a stereotype of hypersexualization — bigger chests, tight waste, wider hips, and skimpy clothing. Women who play games have things assumed about them, such as the assumption that they are a thot, a “titty streamer” using their cleavage to get more money, or that they are automatically worse at games in comparison to a man or a teenage boy. The <i>Mortal Kombat</i> design reflects this stereotypical portrayal: female ninja characters are designed to show 70% of their skin in comparison to the male equivalent, who are clothed in proper combat uniforms. In fact, studies have shown that playing games with overly sexualized characters have added to the normalization of sexual harassment with men having a greater likelihood to harass women after play. Moreover, in face of these depictions, female users also experience diminished self-worth and self-objectification where they become critical of themselves, their appearance, their lives, etc. This degrading behavior toward women has led them to become more fearful of participation in such a male-dominant community and choose to hide their identities rather than fight against ill treatment.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Despite men traditionally being the vocal majority of gamers,</span> in the Entertainment Software Association report of 2013, 55% of gamers were identified as male with the remaining 45% identifying as female. This important statistic signifies that women have just as much interest for video games as their male counterparts. It also brings to attention how poorly represented women are portrayed in video games. Many of them fall into the stereotype of “damsels in distress” or showcased “as objects of the male gaze: most women appear to be hardly older than 30, in most cases wear skin tight, figure-accenting clothing and are slim (Kondrat, 2015).” However, it is important to realize that this representation of women is not a problem exclusive to games. The problem actually lies further up the ladder and that entity is called “established social norms.” Video games are an entertainment industry that has overtaken television and cinema and has become one of the largest media outlets of the modern world. Just like any industry however, money will always be a high incentive, the ultimate goal — and the best way to maximize profit is to appeal to the largest possible audience: men. Even in 2019, this incentive is the major reason as to why overly-sexualized character designs continue to fill the headlines.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">In the April of 2019,</span> <i>Mortal Kombat 11</i> was released to the public with an extensive change in character design that included new visual updates for the female characters. Devoted fans who were used to the old “women fighting in sexy clothes” did not appreciate such a change and criticized it. There was an eruption on social media calling the designs “ugly” and how the women “looked like men,” even though the changes were relatively minute; the designers gave them more clothes and updated their face structure to modern 3D rigging for better cutscene animations. On the other hand, some have pointed out that quite a few of the male characters have shirtless options, so even though going in a bikini into battle is not practical, as the developers have stated, then what about the men? But the issue is that the male characters do not look sexualized or are portrayed as eye candy, so that argument is shaky. So even though on the development end, design and treatment of women is slowly getting to an ideal state of equal treatment, the audience is much slower to accept it.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Angela Washko</span> is one such artist who creates feminist games as social commentary on the misrepresentation of women in games. One of her games, <i>The Game: The Game</i>, is a work that defies modern game standards. <i>The Game<i> takes on the genre of a dating simulator, a genre that can help people build skills for feeling more comfortable around the opposite sex. Her approach is from the perspective of a woman who is being hit on by creeps at the bar. <i>The Game: The Game</i> features mainly male characters who fancy themselves as pick-up artists. However, things quickly become disturbing and suspenseful as the player begins to feel nervous and uncomfortable as the eerie music turns scary and the men become more abusive and corrupt. It puts into perspective of how scary it can be sometimes to be a woman and how men are not making things easier by seeing women as objects to be won instead of people. Seeing people as something less than people is traditionally the first step towards discrimination and disregard for human rights.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Furthermore,</span> Angela Washko also discusses the uniquely sexist environment of the culture within the game <i>World of Warcraft</i>, one of the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). She states that some women desire to remain anonymous in order to not be found out and avoid sexism. This is not necessarily a good strategy for the long term. This only serves to let the male players continue to assume that there are no women playing the game, and perpetuates the echo chamber of unawareness, blatant sexism, and dehumanization. When Washko decided to discuss feminist topics openly in chat within <i>World of Warcraft</i>, many disturbing and upsetting comments were said about her. She was told countless times to “go back to the kitchen and make sandwiches.” The others in chat were calling feminists, as a whole, communists and man-haters, which is in and of itself such a misinformed statement that it comes off as a joke. All of this serves to show that male gamers are incredibly misinformed and the echo chamber that they exist in perpetuates feelings of fear in women gamers and a desire for secrecy as a temporary solution to the problem.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">In addition, another example involves Ji Firepaw,</span> an AI character within the game who engages in sexist dialogue. The greeting of a male vs female is gender specific; for the female character, the focus is on how beautiful she is rather than how strong. Ji Firepaw greets a female character with, “ Hello, friend! You’re some kind of gorgeous, aren’t you? I bet you can’t keep the men off you! Join me! You and I are going to be good friends!”(Braithwaite, 2014). Here we can see how the focus of the female character is based on beauty. On the other hand, the greeting of a male character is, “Hello, friend! You’ve got a strong look to you! I bet you’re all the rage with the ladies! Join me! You and I are going to be good friends!” (Braithwaite, 2014). For the male character, it is his strength that is being focused on. Even though this dialogue is brief and often overlooked, frequent interactions can indirectly influence a player whether he/she realizes it.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px"> Games should not be limited to men but open to all who seek to enjoy the pleasure of virtual entertainment.</span> One argument for pushing social norms towards a celebration of intersectionality was made by the group who call themselves the Xenofeminists. This group argues that, though typically it is women that are heard about being treated poorly and with fewer rights, people who do not fall into typical categories of gender and race are treated poorly as well. Their manifesto urges society towards a celebration of intersectionality and an appreciation of everybody. Feminism has always gone beyond simply fighting for women’s rights. It has been about equal rights for everybody. There is a growing understanding of who everybody is: to include people who do not fall into the traditional gender and race categories. The problem is that society does not believe that women, as well as everybody else, deserve equal representation and inclusion.

      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Temporary solutions are not what this generation is about.</span>We grew up being told that anything is possible as long as you fight for it. Feminism is about everybody, not just women. It is time for everyone to take a stand. Women need to be proud that they are gamers who refuse to submit to stereotypes and male gamers need to stand up for them. If people do nothing and remain anonymous then the echo chamber wins. Although it is impossible to completely ignore stereotyping, it is achievable to represent them in a light that is appealing to both genders. To expand Feminism in the game space, we must become feminist game developers, and feminist consumers. Feminist game developers must include protagonists who represent multiple spectrums of humanity in a positive light and do not appear hypersexualized. As feminist game consumers, we must support games that portray women and humanity in a way that has a strong, positive influence on society. As feminist stream consumers, we need to support women streamers for the content of their videos, not because they show a little skin. As feminist people, we need to remember that people have an inherent value and fundamental worth that should not be forgotten in society.
