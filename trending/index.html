														 <h2> #TrendingNow </h2>

													 Human behavior has undergone a massive shift brought about by the rise of social media influence.
													 Actions broadcast through social media platforms reach viral status, seen by thousands of people
													  from all over the world due to the Internet’s accessibility. For this paper, we examine the
														causes of trends as well as its implications outside the virtual world. Our goal is to try to
														understand the anatomy and lifecycle of a trend and its impact on social behavior. In studying
														this, we will observe the structures of an online trend, why people attach themselves to trends
														in terms of psychological reasonings, and where these trends make the most impact. We will look
														not only online, but in how users consume information and represent themselves to others both online
														 and away from the keyboard. It is important in this era of the Internet to understand how this
														 new form of communication will alter societal fabrics and what that means for society going forward.

														<br>
														<br>
														The rapid growth and participation in social media networks have become the catalysts for viral online trends
														 and challenges. Users are able to share headlines, opinions, and statuses internationally through their social
														 media profiles. While the news, opinions, and statuses are important to the structure of how and what
														 information users receive, our main question is how do trends or challenges become popular? Looking at
														 influencer marketing is one way to understand how these crazes emerge within the constructs of social media
															and make their way into the physical world. In the dissertation, “#Sponsored: The Emergence of Influencer
															 Marketing,” Steve Woods explains that consumers are most likely to respond to a message positively if it
															 derives from trusted friends or personas. According to Swant, a joint study done by Twitter and Annalect, a
																provider of data-driven marketing strategies, 56 percent of the users who were surveyed relied on recommendations
																from friends and family while 49 percent referred to reviews from influencers. The study further emphasizes
																 the impact of influencers, such as celebrities, on filtering products and ideas that are beneficial for
																 not only the influencer but also for the general public. Marketing strategies integrate social media influencers
																	due to their role in shaping consumers’ opinions on certain products and brands. This observation indicates
																	the potential power influencers have through word-of-mouth promotion. In this sense, the power of influencers
																	 can not only be applied to products and brands, but it can also be applied to news, notable debates, and
																	 other noteworthy topics.

					 In addition, influencers and “opinion leaders” act as aids in the successful distribution of new ideas, products,
						and Internet slang. Leihan Zhang, Jichang Zhao, and Ke Xu filtered tweets from a Weibo API (application program
						interface) to determine the peaks of popular Internet slang. They found that there are two stages of popularity
						occurring for each chosen Internet phrase. The initial peak represents small-scale coverage while the second peak
						 illustrates large-scale coverage. They discovered that a large following suggests the number of potential listeners
							there is in the presence of a new word or phrase, but information is traveled more locally. In the second peak,
							 the participation of ordinary users helped spread information across various networks at a faster rate. So, the
								factors that constitute a trend or challenge going viral relies on the collective attention of ordinary users
								and active online engagement through reposting, commenting, replying, mentions.
								<br>
								<br>
								For example, Jake Paul, a YouTube celebrity with over 18 million subscribers, participated in the Bird Box challenge
								in which the goal is to go about daily activities while blindfolded. The challenge appears to be amusing yet threatening.
								 As a response to this challenge, Paul is seen driving and walking aimlessly onto a busy Los Angeles street blindfolded.
									With an audience ranging from eight to 16 years old, Paul’s influence can potentially put his 18 million followers in
									danger. This is a prime example of how a celebrity’s words and actions can heavily sway the younger generation into
									thinking or doing hazardous stunts in return for views and likes. To put this into perspective, users receive information
									 from various sources, popular or not; then, they must evaluate exactly what to do with the information they are given.
										It is then up to the user to determine whether or not to participate through sharing or buying a product, consuming
										the information, or to do nothing to further its influence.

				 Social media platforms have been integrated into our everyday lives to the point where it affects how people interact with
				 it and with other users. The public generally follows trends such as challenges where they watch a viral video, and if
				 they are feeling adventurous, they try the challenge out for themselves. With huge platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,
				 and Instagram allocating public communication, there are unseen factors that users who do post influential material are
				 not aware of. In the article “The relationship between addictive use of social media, narcissism, and self-esteem”, written
				  by Cecilie Schou Andreassen, she argues about why we are addicted to social media. She then explains how people tend to
					 have a fear of missing out on what is happening around them. It is easy to stay in touch with the world now when we have
					  phones to quickly access social media that can connect us instantly. Easy accessibility can lead to excessive use to
						the point where people can feel anxious when they are disconnected for a long period of time. A researcher from the
						University of Begen discovered that there is a correlation between addictive social media use and narcissism through
						a survey from Norway’s national newspapers website. The statistics show that the users that tend to be on social media
						 more, use it to feed their ego. In another journal, ”Social media and its implications for viral marketing” written
						 by Natalie Lammas, she addresses the “social bandwagon” and why people follow along with posts. Usually, viral content
						 rises on the “social bandwagon” which in turn, affects people to think they are missing out if they do not fulfill the
						 challenges or meet everyone’s supposed expectations. Therefore, the users try to follow along with the trends to be in
						 the “trendy” group. In the book, Influence by Robert Cialdini, he investigates how advertisements persuade us to buy.
						 These same processes could also relate to why people follow along with trends.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 As social media trends continue to garner more and more users, there is no doubt that future generations will continue
						 following challenges. The majority of participants that engage in these activities tend to be youth or young adults. This
							is the age group that is currently the most active on social media. Individuals usually participate in these challenges
							out of curiosity, boredom, or as previously stated, the feeling of missing out on what the rest of the world is occupied
							 with. As a result, this generation of young adults may also be affected emotionally and physically, depending on the type
								of challenge they participate in.

		 For instance, the Cinnamon Challenge was one of the most popular and notorious challenges that affected the public
		 negatively due to how dangerous and harmful cinnamon can physically be to a person. The challenge was to try to swallow
		  a tablespoon full of cinnamon powder within a minute, but since cinnamon is a substance that doesn’t completely break
			down, it can stay in one’s system for years and eventually build up in their system. Statistics have revealed that at
			least 30 people have been sent to the hospital because of this trend, and “that the growing Internet presence of the
			Cinnamon Challenge has led to a significant rise in calls to the American Association of Poison Control Centers”, which
			 reveals how dangerous a social media challenge can be. Despite the consequences, many people are still willing to risk
			 their lives just to be a part of the experience. The Cinnamon Challenge has not been the only physically harmful challenge
			 . In fact, there are hundreds of these life-threatening challenges that people, especially teens, try out because they think
			  “it’s funny”. In her article, “Disturbing Trend of Deadly Social Media Challenges”, Fiona Guy expresses the understanding
				that “teens compete with each other viewing the entire game as a fun and amusing activity to ease their boredom and achieve
				 respect from their friends”, explicitly showing how much teens care about how people view them and how much respect they
				  get from participating in these challenges. The effects of these social media challenges are impactful to the public,
					 particularly to teens because they are not only constantly looking for new and “fun” things to do, but they are also
					 trying to find validation and acceptance through participating in dangerous activities.
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 In contrast to the Cinnamon Challenge, the ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as the Ice Bucket Challenge is
					 one that benefits the public. ALS is a disease in one’s nervous system that weakens their muscles and physical abilities
					 and can lead to paralyzation. The Ice Bucket Challenge is to raise awareness about ALS and encourage donations to charities
					 or associations. According to an article from Tufts University, “the Ice Bucket Challenge may be one of the most powerful
						examples of the influence of social media over our behavior”, portraying how effective social media is in bringing people
						 together when raising awareness. It is also stated that there has been an increase of likes on Facebook and followers on
							Twitter, along with the number of participants engaging in this challenge. This particular trend shows the beneficial
							and positive aspects of social media challenges.

		 The Internet and social media have opened pathways of communication allowing users previously unparalleled access to
	 	communities and ideas that they otherwise would be unaware of. The development of social habits has created drastic
	 	change, propagating at an increasingly rapid rate due to the level of accessibility and the power of influencers that
	 	 the Internet provides. Knowing this, it’s important to continue conversations that consider the long-term ramifications
	 	 of these new technological systems and to gain a more profound understanding of the underlying factors that have made
	 	  such systems so impactful. More specifically, we have to consider that the next generation is influenced and affected
	 		by activities circulating throughout the Internet. In a broad sense, we are looking at a dramatic shift in the way
	 		ideas culminate, who looks at these ideas, and what exactly do they do with the information they are given. Looking
	 		at the structure and nature of social media and viral content, we believe that trends and challenges will continue
	 		on the Internet. Trends and challenges are a platform for positive social change; however, they also allow for
	 		advanced forms of exploitation that has never before been possible. It is imperative that society evaluates trends
	 		 as a means of cultural development, and assesses how we want to deal with these phenomena moving forward.
	 		  Trends are massively powerful in their ability to change social perception, and therefore require vigilance on
	 			the part of us experienced users in order to make sure that power shifts in a positive direction rather than
	 			putting ourselves and future generations in danger.
