			  <h2>#TrendingNow</h2>

			  <p>	As the Internet has rapidly become the main conduit of information and communication, our society has been evolving
					 alongside it. This has led to a change in behavioral communication habits that sees people of this era engaging in
					 previously unprecedented behavior. Symptomatic of this evolution is development of trends in terms of massive cultural
					  connectivity. Trends have had relatively a large impact on society in the past, however now aided by the expansive
						 reach and gravitas of 	the Internet, they captivate a much larger and a more diverse audience. We seek to explore
						 the relationship of trends, as virtual constructs, and their impact on our culture. To do this it is important to
						 understand the definition of a trend, the structures of trends that allow them to so effectively capture the
						  attention of our society, and how the effects of trends have appeared past virtual space. With these factors we
							hope to gather information to accurately define the developed role that the Internet and current information
							technologies have played in the present state of societal development.
