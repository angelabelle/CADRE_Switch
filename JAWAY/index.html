         Imagine, it's the year 2019, but not our 2019. The Cold War never ended, the US and the Soviet Union remain superpowers in dispute. The drive for technological advancements created by the Cold War’s urgency to gain the
                upperhand has
                led to discoveries and breakthroughs not seen yet in our time. We have dabbled with nuclear technology in the past, but it proved too destructive, and was less of a threat to the enemy as it was a threat to the entire planet. The
                beginnings of artificially intelligent technology was first conceived at a Dartmouth College conference in 1956, similarly to our time, and has come a long way from analyzing and learning checker strategies.

                These technologies, however, were quickly recognized for their ability to perform dangerous tasks without putting human lives in danger. Breakthroughs in AI technology were abundant in the years after its initial development, soon
                being able to receive combat commands while simultaneously taking in information and reacting to its environment on the battlefield. As both countries advanced their models of robotic intelligence, the focus for combat technology has
                been diverted elsewhere to more covert and stealth infiltration based tactics. Espionage was now a much more viable option for intelligence gathering without human lives at risk. Improvements were made in communication and speech for
                robot models as AI technology approached closer and closer to our idea of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, the combination of AI in any small elements to simulate the larger general human experience.

                Androids now exist as fully aware machines with the ability to receive commands and also adapt to unforeseen circumstances, and advancements have been made in organic technology to help these androids cross the concept of the uncanny
                valley. Now, with the combination of artificially intelligent robot androids, that are almost indistinguishable from humans, and the Cold War still pushing both countries’ drive to get a leg up in the technological race, education of
                the youth became a top priority. The decision has been made to place androids in teaching environments in order to learn each individual student’s needs and preferred method of instruction, greatly increasing the youth’s interest in
                education and contributions to society outside of academia. This is a scenario in which AI instructors would be beneficial to society.

                These AI instructors will be able to provide the best and most efficient education possible and potentially replace current human instructors in grades K-12. Each student will be assigned a personalized AI instructor so that each AI
                can adapt its learning style to best suit each student’s unique needs. The AI instructor is able to adapt on a daily basis, and has the ability to store and link information together to build a greater connection with its student. It
                works with advanced technology to present the student with the information in different forms for each lesson, whether it be projections, images, and/or text. This allows for a more personal experience than our education system’s
                current classroom settings where the instructor has his or her attention divided and has only one way of teaching based on their own experience.

                The AI Instructor will be everyone’s best teacher. At first glance, there appears to be no difference between the AI and a human. Both are human in shape with similar heights, pairs of eyes, limbs, a nose, a mouth, and anything else
                that one may associate with a human. However, these AI instructors do have some key differences. The most upfront difference is its skin. It does appear paler in comparison to that of a human and it also consists of a special
                pressurized polymer engineered to resist long-term wear and tear. Along its arms, panel lining can be seen throughout where they can fold out thin robotic arms that can extend twice the length of its arms to be able to reach areas
                that may be too high, narrow, or otherwise difficult to reach with normal human limbs. On its hand feature holographic projectors on the tips of their fingers (a projector for each finger for a total of ten) to be able to project
                multiple holographic imageries to either compliment them together as a whole or to project separate visuals that will assist individual students. The eyes also have a distinct characteristic of faintly illuminating around the pupils
                as well as the added feature of seeing in a full visual spectrum to visually identify effects on the students unseen by humans such as body temperature and health. These AI instructors also have the ability to communicate with their
                students outside of physical contact or campus by connecting to the students’ mobile devices to assist students academically. This would allow the AI instructor to remain close by and be able to monitor their students and provide
                relevant information to continue educating them.

                The functions and technologies of the AI instructor create an immersive way of learning that improves engagement with students thanks to its adaptive learning capabilities. Because so much technological advancement has come after the
                Cold War, the possibilities of the AI are close to infinite now. And we are in the presence of something grand: An android with the capabilities of detecting and projecting human emotion and intellect. So many advancements have
                propelled our technologies. In the year 1989, Theodore A. Bordeaux invented a speech recognition system which works with the phonemes in our speech to detect and translate it into language by machine. It had pushed speech recognition
                software to understand natural and real- time conversation. In the year 2006, Nicu Sebea and his fellow researchers published an article that stated that the awareness of emotion would be something that would push the potential of
                AI. AI could become human.

                They were able to start with the Real Time Facial Expression Recognition System, which focused on recognizing real-time expressions that happen more naturally and diversely compared to the System Facial Action Coding System (FACS)
                that Paul Ekman and his partner had created to detect Universal Expressions based off of image detection. They were definitely onto something much more real. These initial research topics were stepping stones that would cause an
                avalanche of engineers, scientists, and researchers to fully invest in AI. Multitudes of collaborative research had allowed the US to replicate the left and right hemispheres of our brain into an AI system. The AI is now able to
                directly interact with a human as if it were one itself. We are taking advantage of this finished research that was solely pursued by the military and inserting it into the educational field as an AI Instructor.

                The difference between the human instructor and the AI instructor would be its limitless memory, its collection of information instantly, and its ability to adapt seamlessly to every student possible without skipping a beat (if it
                had a heartbeat). It would be so advanced that the student would not be able to tell that it was not interacting with a human.The algorithms of AI Instructor are designed to make decisions using real-time data collected from sensors,
                digital data, and inputs as well as using information already learned in the past. Combining and analyzing a variety of information from multiple sources simultaneously, the AI Instructor is capable of making any kind of decisions
                and holding intelligent conversations on any topic. It is not only far smarter than any other technology ever created, but also certainly smarter than all humans put together.

                This self-aware AI Instructor is able to sense a human presence, understand student communications, and respond to their requests. The conscious, intelligent, and personified mind of the AI instructor will blur the line between the
                artificial and the natural and become a friend for a student. A friend, that within milliseconds is able to extract data from the vast wealth of information present on the Internet and elsewhere and get the answer to any question
                raised by a student. A friend, who can find the most up-to-date and expertly-written information in any discipline by searching for scholarly articles published in academic journals and electronic library databases all around the
                world. The AI instructor can prepare students for a digital future by bringing the latest knowledge into the classroom and developing new lesson plans in any field, helping students get the most out of the classroom. The AI
                instructor stores all the information gathered in a database and then inserts the resources and activities into a learning environment. The database includes information concerning the student, such as personal data, performance
                data, and data from student interaction with the Instructor. Every student interaction in the environment is saved in the database in the form of a log. Similarly, the student’s performance in each of the activities and tasks is
                stored in the database that updates constantly during every interaction with the student.

                As AI applications accelerate across many sectors, it is vital that we reimagine our educational institutions for a world where AIs will become ubiquitous and where they can cater their approach towards a student’s preferred learning
                styles. If our course of history took this path, perhaps the education of all students would be in better hands. It is important to nurture all these ways of learning and to assist students in their field of interests. This kind of
                future can still be realized if the world simply put more research and development into artificial intelligence. Not all AI related outcomes are malignant or demoralizing. With an AI instructor, the future educational system will
                become more efficient and productive while maintaining a versatile and enjoyable teaching style that accommodates individual learning in a classroom environment. This way of learning can still be realized.
