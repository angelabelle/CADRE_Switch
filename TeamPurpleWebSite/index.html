    <i>//Artificial technologies are advancing so fast that they are now used in many mainstream applications. The growing numbers of smarter AI raises concern in their effectiveness of making autonomous decision. Understanding the traveling salesman problem will help locate some issues within modern AI technology use by big companies like YouTube. YouTube uses AI to moderate and control the types of videos that shows up to the user. Evaluating its algorithm reveals that the system have certain flaws YouTube is ignoring. Self-driving cars are another hot topic that use AI to make important decisions. How does an AI determine which decision is better than the others and is it morally right? As technology extends human tasks, it is important to evaluate inseparable scenarios between humans and machine.</i>

  //As technology advances, AI become a more integral part of everyday life. AI technologies are now used in many mainstream applications. All mobile devices, for example, have some form of intelligent personal assistants on them such as Siri, Cortana, and Google. These AIs are embedded with various artificial technologies such as natural language processing, smart searches, intelligent interface, and recommendation systems. The growing numbers of smarter AI and their autonomous decision making raises some questions for optimization. These questions fall under the topic of graph theory.

//Graph theory is not simply just the study graphs; “it is the sub-field of mathematics concerned with networks of points connected by lines.” Graphs are important for representing mathematical structures that model relations between objects. It is one of the most useful tool in the branches of mathematics and computer science for visualizing data and modeling real world systems. Within graph theory lies a certain interest for problems that deals with finding the best path on a graph. A well-known problem is the traveling salesman problem “which continues to attract the attention of many researchers because of its applications in routing data, products, and people.” Knowing more about traveling salesman problem(TSP) will help us identify underlying issues within artificial intelligent systems like YouTube and self-driving cars.

//The studying of TSP began in the mid-nineteenth century with Irish Mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton and by the British Mathematician Thomas Penyngton Kirkman. Hamilton created the Icosian Game, a mathematical game that required players to find a Hamiltonian cycle along the edges of a dodecahedron. The Hamiltonian cycle is a path within a graph that visits every vertex only once. TSP was not officially recognized until it was studied and redefined by Dr. Karl Menger, Professor of Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in the 1930s. <!-- </p> -->

//TSP seems easy to understand but it is much more difficult to solve. The formula for calculating the number of routes through given cities is (n-1)!/2  where n represents the number of cities. Given a small amount of cities we could easily identify, from the results, which is the most optimal routes. For example, five cites yields (5-1)!/2 giving us 12 possible routes. Unfortunate, a problem arises when we introduce larger numbers into the equation. Modern computers cannot go through all possibilities that TSP produce. Finding the most optimal route between just 11 cities yields 1,814,400 possibilities to search through.<!-- </p> -->

//TSP is one of the most intensely studied problems in computational mathematics and yet no effective solution method is known for the general case. The TSP is an NP-complete problem, meaing that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time due to the extreme number of cases.

//Far from being just a mathematical curiosity, the TSP has many practical applications. Scientists have been finding ways to optimize the process in logistics and social networking. Delivery companies like UPS and FedEx need to constrain the numbers of trucks they have for every delivery route. UPS has a driving system, designed by their programmers and software engineers, that encourage drivers to make less left turns to save time. Another application is music production and distribution. There is an artist named Jason who use to produce new music using graph theory. He also used common industry applications like MySQL and PHP to create his musical score based on pieces that people enjoyed; the web application is called graph theory. The application forms a community that comes together to write electronic music. <!-- </p> -->

//YouTube's recommendations system, which is part of google, is comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. “The candidate generation network takes events from the user’s YouTube activity history as input and retrieves a small subset(hundreds) of videos from a large corpus.” The algorithm tries its best to deconstruct its audience by paying attention to things like: what they do or don’t watch, how much time they spend watching, likes and dislike, and feedbacks. During the development phase, Google uses offline metrics to test for performance but the final decision on whether the algorithm should be implemented comes from A/B testing. <!-- </p> -->

Applying A/B testing to online sites, “it is the process of testing and comparing two similar versions (A and B) of one or more web/mobile pages to determine which ones per­form better and produce better conversion rates-which can include sales, hits, leads, and click-throughs-among randomly sampled, but similar, visitors.”<!-- </p> -->

//On their creator’s site, YouTube stated that its goal is to get people to watch more videos that they enjoy so that they comes back to YouTube regularly. An issue with this is that YouTube is closing their users in a bubble and preventing them from experiencing new content and variety across their huge platform. At the moment, YouTube’s AI technology is not advance enough to determine what we want to watch. Instead, it is basically showing us videos relevant to other videos we already seen.  A post on reddit titled Why is Youtube's recommendation system so bad? (submitted on August January 2017) shared different perspectives and experiences with YouTube.

//Similar to TSP, YouTube is incapable of showing every individual search result without slowing down people’s computers so its algorithm prioritizes certain videos over others. How does one keep him or herself from ending up on the bottom of the list or buried in the middle of the scrap pile? Most if not all users rarely spend their time going through the different page results to find the video they are looking for. What happens when someone’s video is on page 20? YouTube’s advice to their creator is simply to do their best in making their videos stand out; offering advice from editing titles to having eye catching thumbnails. In plain English, everyone is on his or her own. Is technology advance enough to let an AI determine and rank the hierarchy videos that appear on the screen? How does it determine if a video is creative or not when this kind of thing is subjective? As stated above, the YouTube algorithm looks for engagement: contents watched, time spent watching, likes and dislikes etc. It is unfair to judge a video simply by just looking at its surrounding activity. <!-- </p> -->

//One of the first steps humanity has taken towards becoming more ingrained with technology is using machines and robots instead of using humans for certain jobs. As Truitt explains in his article Singularity - Are We There Yet? he states that “... robots… were things that were touted as making auto assembly lines more efficient.”  At the time, the machines were used to decrease production time and increase profit for the projects they were used for. Truitt also explains that another new machine used during that time was the ATM, which solved the problem of having to do banking during normal weekday hours. Instead, people could exchange cash at whatever time was convenient, which made banking much easier for the public to do. The question that remains is whether we can let artificial intelligence work with us as efficiently and as often as we use simpler machines today.<!-- </p> -->

//The third scenario is one that has been developing and which is already taking place, called Augmented Reality. In this world, like the Mirror World, data is much more readily available but also viewable on a day to day life where before one might have needed a separate screen to view the data being displayed. In this world, data is all around the viewer and visible instantly because it is displayed at all times on all subjects. Artificial Intelligence could take this information and provide it at the correct moment in order to warn the viewer about oncoming obstacles or news that could be of vital importance at the moment; examples include the alert of traffic accidents and other scenarios that may need to be avoided at the current time. <!-- </p> -->

People are already participating voluntarily in this scenario today, with the emergence of SnapChat and Instagram. As stated above, Youtube is using an algorithm already that shows content to certain viewers, and perhaps hide content from others. Everyone is already taking photos and recording everything they do, which makes the process of monitoring anyone in the world easier to a user or a program with the right access and permissions. <!-- </p> -->

//These four scenarios show how Artificial Intelligence and machinery are becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives. Some of this integration may seem too personal and intrusive, but it is our reality that we are slowly developing toward. We as a species are getting more advanced with the technology we create, and we are designating parts of our lives to Artificial Intelligence and machines whether we realize what we are doing, or maybe do not realize but accept in order to move forward with new technology and innovation.
